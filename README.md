# Packet-Switcher by Deasia Craig
Java-based network simulation that demonstrates how data packets are queued, delayed, and transmitted through a router — showcasing buffering, packet drops, and transmission timing.

# Packet Switching Simulator (Java)

This project simulates how **network packets** move through a **router** using the concept of **packet switching** — demonstrating buffering, queue management, and transmission delays in a simple, interactive way.

Developed in **Java**, this simulation shows how routers process network packets, handle congestion, and experience buffer overflow scenarios.

## Overview

The simulator models:
- **Packets**: Each packet has an ID, size, and transmission delay.
- **Router**: A router with a configurable buffer that queues and forwards packets.
- **Transmission Delay**: Each packet experiences a random delay before successful transmission.
- **Buffer Overflow**: When the buffer is full, new packets are dropped (simulating real-world congestion).

## Features
- Simulates real-time packet transmission with random delays
-  Demonstrates queue-based router buffering
-   odels dropped packets when buffers overflow
-    Uses OOP principles (`Packet` and `Router` classes)
-     Perfect example for networking fundamentals and simulation-based learning
